Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown of games that can be won primarily through strategy, those that involve randomness but have a high chance of winning due to their mechanics, and the software providers associated with them:

### Strategy-Based Games
- **Roulette**:                          While roulette involves elements of luck, players can increase their chances of winning by using strategies like betting on red or black, odd or even numbers, or certain sections of the wheel. Providers offering roulette include Evolution Gaming, Microgaming, and Playtech.
- **Poker**:                             Poker is a game where skill plays a significant role. Players can win based on their hand strength and strategic decisions during gameplay. Software providers known for poker games include Microgaming and Betsoft.
- **Blackjack**:                         Similar to poker, blackjack requires both skill and knowledge of basic strategy to maximize winnings. Providers like Evolution Gaming and Microgaming offer blackjack games.
Poker (some variations):                 In some poker variations, like Texas Hold'em, skill and strategy can influence your chance of winning.
Baccarat (limited):                      Basic strategy can involve deciding when to bet on the banker or player hand, but the influence is minimal.
Roulette (limited):                      In some advanced roulette strategies, there might be a chance to slightly influence the odds. However, this is not recommended for beginners and the house edge remains significant.


Games that are purely random:

Slots (all types)
Bingo
Keno
Scratchcards
Dice games (like Craps)
Wheel games (like Spin the Wheel)
Most 1xGames (like Aviator, Crash, Minesweeper)



  
  
### Randomized Games with High Winning Potential
- **Slots**: Many slot games are randomized, meaning outcomes cannot be predicted. However, some slots feature high RTP (Return to Player) rates, increasing the likelihood of winning over time. Providers like Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, and Playtech offer a variety of slots with varying levels of volatility and RTP.
- **Crash Games**: These games involve a multiplier that increases until it crashes. Players can cash out at any time, and the higher the multiplier, the higher the potential win. Providers like Spribe and Gamezix offer crash games.
- **Drop & Wins**: These are promotional events where players can earn points or rewards based on their gameplay. While luck plays a part, participating in these events can significantly increase one's chances of winning. Providers like Pragmatic Play and Yggdrasil Gaming host drop & wins.

### Software Providers
- **Playtech**: Offers a mix of strategy-based games like roulette and blackjack, along with various slots with different themes and features.
- **Microgaming**: Known for its extensive library of slots, including some with high RTP rates, as well as table games like poker and blackjack.
- **Evolution Gaming**: Specializes in live dealer games, providing a realistic casino experience where strategy plays a crucial role.
- **Pragmatic Play**: Provides a wide range of slots with varying themes and features, some of which may offer high RTP rates. They also offer crash games and participate in drop & wins.

It's important to note that while strategy can influence the outcome in some games, luck remains a significant factor in many online casino games. Always gamble responsibly.

Important to note:

Even in games with some strategic influence, the house always has an edge. This means that over time, the casino is more likely to win than the player.
The strategies mentioned for some games (Blackjack, Poker, Roulette) require significant skill and knowledge to be effective.
If you're looking for games where you can potentially influence the outcome with skill, table games like Blackjack or some Poker variations might be a better choice. However, remember that the house edge still exists.  Always gamble responsibly and be aware of the risks involved.
